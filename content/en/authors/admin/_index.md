I am a student of mechanical engineering at [APRILab](https://aprilabntu.wixsite.com/website). I studied on control of a Mecanum wheeled platform. My contributions include proposing a useful dynamic model, proposing an effective controller, and conducting simulations and experiments to show the effectiveness of the controller. I can apply classic/analytical mechanics to model a mechanical linkage, and design a controller for it. I can also program many projects, for examples, the frontend and backend of a web app, and programs run in a micro-controller. I use C++, Python, Javascript, Typescript, Kotlin, C# depending on the situation. I am familiar with many tools relating to software development like Git, CMake, Gradle, SSH, and Docker. I am also familiar with Linux. I can complete a variety of tasks with a command-line. My dream career is something full of challenges, mathematics, and which can create lots of value.
